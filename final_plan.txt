# n8n Automation Template Repository: Comprehensive Issue Management & Prevention Plan

---

## 1. Problem Identification

### 1.1. **Issue Triage**
- **Review** all new issues for type (bug, support, documentation, feature), severity, and affected templates.
- **Assign** a maintainer (on a rotating basis) to triage and reproduce the issue in a test n8n environment matching the reporterâ€™s setup.
- **Gather** logs, error messages, and screenshots to confirm the root cause.

### 1.2. **Root Cause Analysis**
- **Diagnose** if the issue is due to:
  - Template misconfiguration
  - n8n version incompatibility
  - External API changes
  - Documentation gaps
  - Credential/dependency issues
- **Document** findings in the issue tracker for transparency and future reference.

---

## 2. Solution Implementation

### 2.1. **Apply the Fix**
- **Correct** node settings, parameters, or credentials as needed.
- **Update** templates for n8n version compatibility; document version/API requirements in metadata.
- **Adjust** for external API changes (endpoints, authentication).
- **Expand** or clarify documentation, including troubleshooting steps.

### 2.2. **Validation & Peer Review**
- **Test** the fixed template end-to-end with valid/invalid credentials and various input scenarios, across all supported n8n versions.
- **Submit** a pull request referencing the original issue.
- **Request** peer review using a standardized checklist (correctness, compatibility, documentation, error handling).

### 2.3. **Repository Update & Communication**
- **Commit** the fixed template and documentation, referencing the issue in the PR.
- **Notify** the issue reporter, explain the fix, and request confirmation of resolution.
- **Update** the `CHANGELOG.md` and mark deprecated templates if necessary.

## 3. Workflow Steps

| Step         | Action                                                                 | Owner         | Time Estimate |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------|
| Triage       | Review, reproduce, log                                                 | Maintainer    | 1-2 hrs      |
| Fix          | Correct config, update for compatibility, fix docs                     | Developer     | 2-4 hrs      |
| Validate     | Test, peer review, confirm fix                                         | Dev/Reviewer  | 2-3 hrs      |
| Update       | Commit, reference issue, communicate                                   | Developer     | 1 hr         |
| Monitor      | Watch for recurrence, automate validation                              | Maintainer    | Ongoing      |

## 4. Best Practices

### 4.1. **Repository Structure & Documentation**
- **Standardize** directory naming and add `README.md` to each main folder.
- **Require** template metadata (supported n8n version, credentials, API dependencies).
- **Use** versioned subfolders for templates with specific requirements.
- **Maintain** central guides (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `TEMPLATES_GUIDE.md`) and a `CHANGELOG.md`.

### 4.2. **Code Quality & Testing**
- **Lint/validate** templates for misconfigurations and missing metadata.
- **Automate** CI checks to:
  - Test templates on all supported n8n versions.
  - Validate credential scenarios.
  - Ensure no hard-coded secrets.
- **Peer review** all changes using a checklist.

### 4.3. **Team Workflow**
- **Enforce** PR-based workflow with protected branches and required reviews.
- **Assign** template owners for accountability.
- **Rotate** issue triage duties among maintainers.

## 5. Risk Mitigation

| Risk Category | Key Risks | Mitigation | Contingency |
|---------------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Technical     | Regression, incomplete fix, version/API issues, credential handling | Comprehensive testing, peer review, CI, docs | Rollback PR, restore previous version, provide workaround, deprecate if needed |
| Operational   | Testing gaps, review delays, comms, monitoring | Assign roles, automate, use templates | Escalate, improve process, allocate resources |
| Business      | User trust, support load, deprecation | Transparency, clear docs, support | Apologize, migrate, allocate resources |

- **Rollback Procedures:** Use version control for quick reverts; maintain previous template versions; document rollback steps.
- **Communication:** Notify users of changes, fixes, and rollbacks; request confirmation of resolution.

---

## 6. Continuous Improvement

- **Monitor** GitHub issues, CI/CD results, and (if possible) anonymized template usage/error metrics.
- **Solicit** user feedback after fixes and encourage broader community input.
- **Conduct** post-mortems for high-severity or recurring issues to identify process or documentation gaps.
- **Expand** automated validation and regression testing as new templates and features are added.
- **Regularly review** and update documentation, best practices, and workflow processes.
