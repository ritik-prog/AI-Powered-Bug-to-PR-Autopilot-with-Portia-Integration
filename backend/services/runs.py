RunService
============

This module provides a simple in‚Äëmemory implementation of the run
management API used by the FastAPI backend. In a production system
you would persist runs to a database such as PostgreSQL and publish
events to Redis for streaming. Here we keep everything in process so
that the example can run without external dependencies.

Each run has a unique ID, metadata about the issue and repository,
timestamps, a status and a list of events. Approval gates are
represented as steps in the run's plan. The ``approve`` method
accepts decisions for the two approval gates defined in the
specification.

class RunService:
    """A lightweight manager for Portia plan runs with a basic state machine.

    This service simulates the lifecycle of a Portia plan run. When a run
    is started the service schedules an asynchronous task that walks
    through each checkpoint in the plan. Certain checkpoints‚Äînamely
    ``propose-fix`` and ``merge-pr``‚Äîare human‚Äëin‚Äëthe‚Äëloop gates. The
    simulation will emit a ``clarificationRequested`` event at these
    gates and pause until the corresponding approval or rejection is
    received via ``approve``. After each state transition, the run's
    status and plan step statuses are updated and an event is pushed to
    the per‚Äërun queue. If a gate is rejected the run terminates and
    subsequent steps are marked as cancelled.

    In a production environment this service would communicate with
    Portia's runtime APIs to execute actual plans, persist state in
    Redis/Postgres and stream logs. Here we provide just enough
    functionality to drive the frontend and unit tests.
